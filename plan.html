<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Brittany Peever<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc319715</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The purpose of the website is to engage a younger audience(high school - young adults) to increase their audience at CossiePlay Parties. The website should call for the users to come along to the cosplay parties and encourage them to buy costumes. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To evaluate the sites success, the rate of purchases/how many registers/party goers will be recorded to see if this increases. How many party goers and how many reserved party goers will show how many were engaged by the site and how many showed.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of this site is people at high school - young adults who may be socially awkward but creativite. To reach this audience the colour scheme of the website will be bright  'disco' colour sets. The front page will feature the call to action of going to the 'CossiePlay Party' with a large DJ image and a boxed 'register now!'. The main banner photo will also feature a group of socialising young people which will be seen on every page of the website. </p>
